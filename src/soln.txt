export 'Switch' (imported as 'Switch') was not found in 'react-router-dom'

two methods to solve this error

1. If you are using react-router-dom version V6.0.0 then it will not work, so downgrade the version of the react-router-dom to be below V6 and run

npm install react-router-dom@5.2.0

if you do not want to downgrade  react-router-dom version then use method 2

2. Use <Routes> instead of <Switch> and the error will go away,
